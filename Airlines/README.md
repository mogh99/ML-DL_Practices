# Airlines Problem
This is a machine learning problem with a dataset that was provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment). The goal is to practice basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset contains customers tweets for six different airlines (Virgin America, United, Southwest, Delta, US Airways, American). 
Each tweet has a sentiment either negative, positive, or neutral. The dataset will be divide into two sets train and test. The train dataset will be used to train the model. And the test dataset will be used to test the model. 
The tweet sentiment will help the machine learning model to classifies the tweets in the test dataset. For more information and details, the solution can be run as jupyter notebook.
